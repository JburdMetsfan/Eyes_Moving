# Eyes_Moving

# Description:
This exercise had me make two identical eyes on the screen and provide the ability to move the inside circles simultaneiously using my mouse. 

# How to Run:
Download all files to your local machine.  Drop the html file on to a blank web page.  Click anywhere on the screen with your mouse and move it around to see the movement in the center of each eye.

# Future Roadmap
Additional Features I would like to add to this project:
  - Ability to add more eyes
  - Allow for different shapes and sizes of the eyes
  - Ability to select background and eye color
